# RISC_V_Single_cycle_processor
A Single Cycle RISC-V processor is a type of microprocessor architecture that follows the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) design philosophy, with the RISC-V instruction set architecture specifically being an open standard. In a single-cycle processor, each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle, resulting in a streamlined and efficient processing pipeline. The key features of a Single Cycle RISC-V processor include a simplified instruction set, uniform instruction format, and a dedicated stage in the pipeline for each step of instruction execution, such as instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write back. This design minimizes the complexity of the processor, allowing for high clock speeds and straightforward instruction execution.
